# Changelog

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-20

### Added

**Multi-Git Repository Support** (Major Feature)
- **Multi-root workspace support** - Each workspace folder with its own git repository is now handled independently
- **Nested repositories / Submodules** - Automatically discovers and manages nested git repos and submodules
- **Always-visible Activity Bar** - Extension panel is always visible, even without a git repository (shows "No Git Repository" message)
- **Repository-specific state** - Each repository maintains its own changelists and snapshots
- **Repository hierarchy in TreeView** - When multiple repos exist, shows hierarchical view with repos at root level; single repo maintains flat view for backward compatibility

### Changed
- **New RepositoryManager** - Centralized management of all git repositories in workspace
- **State key per repository** - Uses unique hash-based keys for storing each repo's state
- **URI handling updated** - Git content provider now includes repository path for proper multi-repo diff support
- **Automatic migration** - Legacy single-repo state is automatically migrated to new format

### Fixed
- **Shelve from Command Palette** - "Shelve to Changelist" now works from command palette using active editor's file

### Technical
- State version bumped to 4
- New activation event: `onView:smartChangelistsView`
- View `when` condition removed for always-visible panel

### Migration Notes
- Existing changelists will be automatically migrated to the new format
- No action required from users - migration happens on first load
